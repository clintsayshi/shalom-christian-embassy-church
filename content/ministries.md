  - desc: This is the division that provides mentorship to Ministers in need of such
      services. Mentees apply in writing and feedback is provided from the
      Senior Pastor, the Apostle. Successfully admitted mentees are required to
      sign a binding contract with the Apostle and Servant of God. The contract
      is basically for protecting the Christian Image, binding through values
      and statement of faith.
